        Anargyros Nicholas Karabourniotis (Ανάργυρος Καραβουρνιώτης, born November 1, 1950), commonly known as Archie Karas,
         is a Greek American gambler, high roller, poker player, and pool shark famous for the largest and longest documented
          winning streak in casino gambling history, simply known as The Run, when he drove to Las Vegas with $50 in December 1992 and
           then turned a $10,000 loan into more than $40 million by the beginning of 1995, only to lose it all later that year.
            Karas himself claims to have gambled with more money in
         casinos than anyone else in history and has often been compared to Nick the Greek, another high-stakes gambler.</p>
